Comment: Even though the code from this Spanish language is BSD licensed, the Spanish
 language support depends on the Saga library, that is GPL-3 licensed. Therefore when
 this voice is linked to the Saga library it becomes GPL as well. Similarly, the mimic
 binaries linking to this language support will become GPL as well.
