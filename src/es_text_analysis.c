    /* Each token has defined four features:
        - The token name: ffeature_string(token,"name");
        - The token prepunctuation: ffeature_string(token,"prepunctuation");
        - The token postpunctuation: ffeature_string(token,"punc");
        - The token whitespace: ffeature_string(token,"whitespace");

       We can also traverse the list of tokens for contextual information:
        - The previous token: cst_item *prev_token = item_prev(token);
        - The next token: cst_item *next_token = item_next(token);

       So we can combine both traversing and accessing features:
        - The name of the next token: ffeature_string(item_next(token), "name");

       As text analysis requires constantly of checking context, we can use
       feature paths:
       Feature paths can be up to 200 characters long.
       Their syntax is implemented in src/hrg/cst_ffeature.c. You may the
       internal_ff function. In summary, feature paths are strings composed of
       operators separated by dots. The most common operators applicable to
       tokens are:
        - "n": Advances to the next token
        - "nn": Advances to the next next token
        - "p": Advances to the previous token
        - "pp": Advances to the previous previous token

        Other cst_item usually require other operators that we won't explore
       now:
        - "parent": Advances to the parent item
        - "daughter": Advances to the first daughter item
        - "daughtern": Advances to the last daughter item
        - "RNameOfRelation": Moves to another relation.

        After the last operator, we typically want access to a token feature:
        - Token. Previous. Name: ffeature_string(token,"p.name");
        - Token. PreviousPrevious. Name: ffeature_string(token,"pp.name");
        - Token. Previous. Name: ffeature_string(token,"p.name");
        - Look the next-next-next token punctuation: ffeature_string(token,
       "nn.n.punc");
